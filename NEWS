5.2.1

- Core libraries
  - Fixed a bug where optimisations for `irregex-match?` would cause
    runtime errors due to the inlined specialisations not being
    fully-expanded (see #1690).
  - Irregex has been updated to upstream 0.9.8, which fixes behaviour
    of irregex-replace/all with positive lookbehind so all matches are
    replaced instead of only the first (reported by Kay Rhodes).
  - current-milliseconds has been deprecated in favor of the name
    current-process-milliseconds, to avoid confusion due to naming
    of current-milliseconds versus current-seconds, which do something
    quite different.  Also, its definition has been tweaked to
    guarantee that it returns the time since process startup.  On
    Windows, it will now return sane values after 24 days of uptime.
    On UNIX, the values returned will be precise to the millisecond
    instead of rounded down to the nearest second at startup (which
    would result in erratic startup times).
  - The default mode for files created by `file-open' has been changed
    to 0666 (plus whatever change the effective umask applies), rather
    than 0744 (see #1698).

- Runtime system
  - Sleeping primordial thread doesn't forget mutations made to
    parameters in interrupt handlers anymore. (See #1638. Fix
    contributed by Sebastien Marie)
  - A feature corresponding to the word size is available
    regardless of the word size (#1693)
  - Deprecated C_(a_i_current_)milliseconds in favor of
    C_(a_i_)current_process_milliseconds to match the Scheme-level
    deprecation of current-milliseconds.
  - Officially deprecated C_pair() in favor of C_a_pair(); it has
    been deprecated for years.
  - At program cleanup, finalizers are only forced when the live
    finalizer count is non-zero
  - A new runtime flag `-:hf' was added, which controls the minimum
    free heap space at which garbage collector will increase the heap
    size.  This is set to 4M by default to prevent excessive
    major GCs when the heap hovers around being almost full.

- Build system
  - Auto-configure at build time on most platforms. Cross-compilation
    still requires PLATFORM to be set, and it can still be provided
    manually, but it is no longer required in the common case.


5.2.0

- Core libraries
  - Fix `memory-statistics` by returning semi-space bytes and used
    semi-space bytes like the documentation says. Old implementation
    returned full-heap size and (full-heap - used-semi-space).
  - for-each and map now behave consistently in compiled and interpreted
    mode, like in SRFI-1.  They now stop when the shortest list is
    exhausted instead of raising an exception (fixes #1422).
  - There is now a srfi-88 module which contains just the three
    procedures from the (chicken keyword) module defined by the SRFI.
  - A feature identifier named "srfi-88" is now registered.
  - The procedures `record-printer` and `set-record-printer!` and a
    corresponding SRFI-17 setter have been added. These deprecate
    `define-record-printer` which isn't a "real" definition (see #1294).
  - On Windows, `decompose-directory` no longer crashes when a drive
    letter is present in the supplied path string.
  - irregex-replace[/all] have been fixed for empty matches, so they
    will no longer drop characters and ignore the replacement (#1661).
  - Irregex has been updated to upstream 0.9.7, which also improves
    how empty matches are treated in irregex-fold and irregex-split.

- Runtime system
  - Quoted empty keywords like ||: and :|| are now read like prescribed
    by SRFI-88 in the corresponding keyword mode.  Symbols containing
    quoted empty prefixes or suffixes like ||:abc and abc:|| will be
    read correctly as symbols now (fixes #1625, thanks to Andy Bennett).
  - IEEE floating point negative zero is now properly handled: it can
    be read, written and distinguished by eqv? and equal?, but not =
    (fixes #1627, thanks to John Cowan).
  - ##sys#check-exact and its C implementations C_i_check_exact and
    C_i_check_exact_2 have been deprecated (see also #1631).
  - When garbage collector is manually invoked from a finalizer, raise
    an error instead of hanging forever (fixes #1586).
  - define-record-type will now give an error if the constructor
    definition refers to field that's not listed elsewhere (see #1633)
  - Added new -:hu option to set the memory usage low watermark
    percentage at which the heap should be shrunk, and changed the
    calculation to actually reflect this (see #1379).

- Compiler
  - Fixed a bug in lfa2 pass which caused "if" or "cond" nodes to be
    incorrectly unboxed if the "else" branch had a flonum result type
    (#1624, thanks to Sven Hartrumpf)
  - Inline files no longer refer to unexported foreign stub functions
    (fixes #1440, thanks to "megane").
  - In some cases, rest argument lists do not need to be reified, which
    should make using optional arguments and case-lambda faster (#1623).
  - Values from foreign types which have an argument or return value
    converter are no longer inferred to have the Scheme type which
    corresponds to the raw foreign type, which was incorrect (#1649).

- Module system
  - Trying to export a foreign variable, define-inlined procedure or
    define-constant variable gives a friendly error instead of saying
    the variable doesn't exist (fixes #1346).
  - When modules are registered, they no longer pollute the global
    environment with imports made in that module (fixes #1548)

- Tools
  - The new "-module-registration" options causes module registration
    code to always be included in the program, even when it has also
    been emitted as a separate file (for example with "-J").
  - chicken-install now correctly checks server response code to avoid
    interpreting error response bodies (like 404, 500) as Scheme code.
  - chicken-install now follows HTTP redirects when downloading eggs.
  - chicken-install will now change to the correct drive before
    attempting to change to the egg directory (fixes #1647).


5.1.0

- Core libraries
  - Symbols ending or starting with a colon are now always pipe-quoted
    when written by `write` to ensure they can be read back with a
    different keyword-style setting.
  - Read-write invariance of special symbols starting with #! other
    than #!key, #!rest or #!optional is now preserved (#1572).
  - When using (set-file-position!) on a port, its EOF status will now
    be reset.
  - In (chicken file posix), the values of perm/irgrp, perm/iwgrp,
    perm/ixgrp, perm/iroth, perm/iwoth and perm/ixoth are now correctly
    defined (they were all for "usr"; #1602, thanks to Eric Hoffman).
  - In (chicken file posix), `file-truncate` now accepts also accepts
    port objects, for consistency with other file procedures.
    All such procedures from (chicken file posix) now have the correct
    types in types.db (fixes #1609, thanks to Robert Jensen).
  - Add the system-config-directory and system-cache-directory procedures
    in the chicken.platform module. These procedures follow the XDG
    specification and also give sensible results on Windows.
  - Fix get-environment from (chicken process-context) to raise an
    error when passed #f instead of segfaulting.
  - Qualified symbols (##foo#bar style) are no longer encoded by a
    byte prefix inside the symbol name.  This ensures read-write
    invariance of symbols which start with a low-byte character
    (fixes #1077, except for keywords, which start with NUL bytes).
  - Fix a missing export (list->s64vector) in SRFI-4.

- Runtime system
  - Keywords are now distinct types; they are not a subtype of symbols.
  - Use arc4random on FreeBSD (thanks to Tobias Kortkamp and gahr)
  - Removed the unused, undocumented (and incorrect!) C functions
    C_delete_symbol_table and C_set_symbol_table.
  - Continuations which discard additional values beyond the first no
    longer accept multiple values via direct invocation after being
    captured through `call/cc`, only via `values` (revert of #1390,
    due to #1601)
  - SRFI-4 vector predicates, reference, set and length procedures
    should now be faster in tight loops as they're inlineable (#757).
  - Keywords are now interned in a separate keyword table, not in the
    standard symbol table.  This brings full read-write invariance
    for symbols (they can now also start with NUL bytes).  Keywords
    no longer have plists.  Fixes #1576.
  - Increased the "binary compatibility version" to 11.

- Compiler
  - Restored optimized implementations of =, +, -, /, * and quotient in
    fixnum-arithmetic mode (fixes #1604 mostly; thanks to "chickendan").
  - Added an optimization pass for reducing the amount of boxing of
    intermediate floating point values, enabled by the "-lfa2" compiler
    option.
  - The "lfa2" pass is now enabled at optimization levels 2 or higher.

- Module system
  - When you try to import the module you are currently defining into
    itself, an error will be raised. This prevents an infinite loop in
    the compiler when later trying to import that same module (fixes
    #1506, thanks to Kristian Lein-Mathisen).

- Foreign function interface
  - Improved hygiene in FFI macro expansions, which means you don't
     have to import "scheme" or "(chicken base)" for them to work.

- Type system
  - It is now possible to quote free variables in type declarations,
     which acts as shorthand for `forall' (thanks to "megane")

- Tools
  - csi now uses (system-config-directory) to find csirc and falls back to
    $HOME/.csirc when needed.
  - chicken-install now uses (system-config-directory) to find a user
    defined setup.defaults file ; it also uses (system-cache-directory)
    for its egg cache directory when the CHICKEN_EGG_CACHE environment
    variable is not defined.

- Egg specifications
  - Allows "cond-expand" and "error" forms in egg specification files.
  - Add "c-object" and "object" properties to link separately compiled
     C objects into CHICKEN code.


5.0.0

- Runtime system
  - Added support for the full numeric tower, including various new
    procedures taken from the "numbers" egg.  All calculations will
    now return exact numbers where possible, so code relying on flonums
    being returned may need to be changed if rational numbers do not
    provide the desired performance.
  - Port directionality has been generalized from a simple input/output
    flag to a bitmap, to allow for multidirectional ports.
  - Weak symbol GC is faster, simpler, and can now collect all
    unreferenced symbols instead of a maximum of 997 per major GC.
  - The -:w option has been removed; symbols are now always collected.
  - Increased the "binary compatibility version" to 9.
  - Continuations which discard additional values beyond the first now
    also accept multiple values via direct invocation after being
    captured through `call/cc`, not just via `values` (#1390)
  - Removed the deprecated C_locative_ref and C_mutate2 C functions.
  - The trace buffer no longer holds on to thread objects, allowing them to
    be garbage collected sooner (#1356, thanks to Kristian Lein-Mathisen)
  - On Cygwin and MinGW, the "build-platform" now corresponds to the
    tool chain used (gnu, clang, unknown) like on *nix, while the
    software-version is now "cygwin" or "mingw32" instead of "unknown".
    This also means the features list will now contain the tool chain
    on all platforms.
  - Symbols starting with #% are no longer treated specially and need
    to be quoted with pipes. This makes the "%" sign available for use
    in custom/user-defined sharp-sign read syntax.

- Compiler
  - Fixed an off by one allocation problem in generated C code for (list ...).
  - The "-scrutinize" compiler option has been removed.
  - The "-module" compiler option (aliased as "-m") now expects a module name.
  - The generated C output of the compiler is now deterministic: it
    will be bit-for-bit identical when compiling the same Scheme file
    with the same version of the compiler.
  - the "-consult-type-file" and "-emit-type-file" options have been renamed
    to "-consult-types-file" and "-emit-types-file", respectively.

- Tools
  - The new "-link" option to csc allows linking with objects from extensions.
  - The new "-libdir" option to csc allows overriding the runtime library
    directory.
  - The ambiguous "-l<libname>" option for csc has been removed (#1193).
  - Removed deprecated "-n" shorthand for "-emit-inline-file" from csc.
  - Removed "chicken-bug" tool.

- Core libraries
  - Removed support for memory-mapped files (posix), queues
    (data-structures), binary-search (data-structures), scan-input-lines
    (utils), group-information (posix) object-eviction (lolevel), and
    compile-file (utils). These are now available as eggs.
  - Removed the srfi-1, srfi-13, srfi-14, srfi-18, srfi-69, and utils
    units. These are now available as eggs.
  - Added the `executable-pathname` procedure for retrieving a path to
    the currently-running executable.
  - Removed all support for SWIG.
  - Removed interrupts-enabled declaration specifier.
  - `sleep` now suspends the current thread when threading is enabled,
    otherwise it sleeps the process. The new `process-sleep` procedure
    in unit posix can be used to sleep the process unconditionally.
  - `with-error-output-to-port' from the ports module has been renamed
    to the more common `with-error-to-port', and `with-error-to-string'
    has been added for completeness (thanks to Michael Silver).
  - A new `make-bidirectional-port' procedure has been added to the
    ports unit that will combine separate input- and output- ports into
    a single bidirectional port.
  - New `input-port-open?` and `output-port-open?` procedures have been
    added for testing whether a port is open in a specific direction.
  - An `include-relative` form has been added to the (chicken base) module.
    This works like `load-relative` but for textual inclusion.
  - Keywords are now always written in "portable" style by WRITE, so
    that the reader's keyword style doesn't need to match the writer's.
  - The environment variable `CHICKEN_PREFIX` has been removed.
  - Added the `glob->sre` procedure to the irregex library.
  - Removed the `get-host-name' and `system-information' procedures.
    These are available in the "system-information" egg.
  - Removed the `eval-when`, `select` and `ensure` macros.  These are
    available in the "miscmacros" egg.
  - Removed the require-extension-for-syntax macro.
  - Renamed bit-set? to bit->boolean because of swapped argument order
    with respect to SRFI-33 and SRFI-60, which was confusing (fixes
    #1385, thanks to Lemonboy).
  - file-{read,write,execute}-access will now raise an exception when
    the file doesn't exist or some other non-access related problem is
    detected (fixes #1386, thanks to Vasilij Schneidermann).
  - `change-file-mode` was renamed to set-file-permissions! and SRFI-17
    generalized set! support has been added for `file-permissions`.
    This procedure now also accepts a file descriptor or a port.
  - `file-permissions` now returns one value: the permission integer.
  - `read-file` has been renamed to `read-list`.
  - `read-all` was dropped, as `read-string` with #f as its NUM argument
     is equivalent.
  - `read-lines` and `read-all` no longer accept a string naming a file,
     only ports.
  - The procedures for random numbers have been reimplemented;
    access to system-specific entropy is available, together with a reasonably
    good pseudo random number generator (WELL512).
  - `glob` now returns an empty list for non-existent or inaccessible
    directories, instead of erroring out.
  - `file-copy' and `file-move' have been renamed to `copy-file' and
    `move-file', for consistency with `delete-file' and `rename-file'.
  - `rename-file' now refuses to overwrite an existing file unless an
    optional "clobber" argument is provided.
  - The `r4rs` module no longer exports `eval`, which was not in R4RS.
  - `process`, `process*` and `process-execute` now expect lists of the form
    (("NAME" . "VALUE") ...) instead of the previous (("NAME=VALUE") ...)
    as their environment argument.
  - `repository-path` is now a parameter containing a list of strings instead
    of a string, as the search path for libraries can now contain multiple
    directories.
  - `file-read-access?`, `file-write-access?` and `file-execute-access?` have
    been renamed `file-readable?`, `file-writable?` and `file-executable?`
    into the (chicken file) module.

- Module system
  - The compiler has been modularised, for improved namespacing.  This
    means names from the compiler should not leak out into the compiled
    program's (macro) namespace anymore.
  - The core units have been converted to modules under the "chicken"
    namespace.
  - Added support for list-style library names.
  - The "use" and "use-for-syntax" special forms have been removed
    in favor of "import" and "import-for-syntax" to reduce confusion.
  - Module imports are now lexically scoped: identifiers provided by
    an (import ...) inside (let ...) won't be visible outside that let.
  - Modules implementing an interface can now correctly export extra
    identifiers (bug reported by Martin Schneeweis, fix by "megane").

- Syntax expander
  - Removed support for (define-syntax (foo e r c) ...), which was
    undocumented and not officially supported anyway.
  - Removed support for normal "lambda" forms as syntax transformers,
    which has been deprecated since 4.8.0.
  - define and friends are now aggressively rejected in "expression
    contexts" (i.e., anywhere but toplevel or as internal defines).
  - define-record and define-record-type now create record types
    which are tagged with the module in which they're defined, so
    predicates no longer return #t for records with the same tag
    defined in another module. This tag is now also available under
    an identifier that matches the record type name (fixes #1342).
  - `include` now splices included expressions in the context in which
    the inclusion appears and does not treat the expressions as toplevel
    expressions by default.

- Eggs management
  - Egg-installation and building has been completely overhauled.
  - .meta + .setup files have been merged into a single declarative
    ".egg" file.
  - More static checks for egg descriptions, simplified generation
    of OS-specific build + install commands that is (hopefully)
    more practical for package maintainers.
  - Egg sources are cached locally to reduce download and rebuild
    times.
  - Dropped many obscure or unimportant options and features from
    `chicken-install`: (`-keep-installed`, `-reinstall`, `-proxy`,
    `-no-install`, `-username`, `-password`, `-init`, `-deploy`,
    `-keep-going`, `-scan`, `-csi`, `-show-depends`, `-show-foreign-depends`,
    `-prefix`.
  - Added new "-from-list" option to chicken-install.
  - Eggs can now be installed and located in multiple directories,
    using the `CHICKEN_REPOSITORY_PATH` + 
    `CHICKEN_INSTALL_REPOSITORY`
    environment variables.
  - Static compilation of eggs is now fully supported and static
    versions of compiled eggs are available by default.
  - In a statically built chicken, the egg-tools ("chicken-install", "...-status",
    "...-uninstall") are still available, but only support static compilation
    of eggs.

- Foreign function interface
  - The foreign type specifier "ssize_t" is now accepted, and "size_t"
    arguments now only accept positive integers.  Return values of
    type size_t are no longer truncated on 32-bit platforms.


4.13.0

- Security fixes
  - CVE-2017-6949: Remove unchecked malloc() call in SRFI-4 constructors
    when allocating in non-GC memory, resulting in potential 1-word
    buffer overrun and/or segfault (thanks to Lemonboy).
  - CVE-2017-9334: `length' no longer crashes on improper lists (fixes
    #1375, thanks to "megane").
  - CVE-2017-11343: The randomization factor of the symbol table was
    set before the random seed was set, causing it to have a fixed value
    on many platforms.

- Core Libraries
  - Unit "posix": If file-lock, file-lock/blocking or file-unlock are
    interrupted by a signal, we now retry (thanks to Joerg Wittenberger).
  - char-ready? on string ports now also returns #t at EOF, as per R5RS;
    in other words, it always returns #t (thanks to Moritz Heidkamp)
  - Unit srfi-4: Fixed typo that broke SRFI-17 generalised set! syntax
    on s8vectors (thanks to Kristian Lein-Mathisen).
  - Large literals no longer crash with "invalid encoded numeric literal"
    on mingw-64 (#1344, thanks to Lemonboy).
  - Unit irregex: Fix bug that prevented multibyte UTF-8 character sets
    from being matched correctly (Thanks to Lemonboy and Chunyang Xu).

- Runtime system:
  - The profiler no longer uses malloc from a signal handler which may
    cause deadlocks (#1414, thanks to Lemonboy).
  - The scheduler no longer indirectly hangs on to the old thread
    when switching to a new one, which caused excessive memory
    consumption (#1367, thanks to "megane").
  - C++ programs no longer fail with a symbol lookup error when
    compiled with debugger support (-d3 or -debug-info).

- Syntax expander
  - Renaming an identifier twice no longer results in an undo of the
    rename (fixes #1362, thanks to "megane").

- Build system
  - Fixed broken compilation on NetBSD, due to missing _NETBSD_SOURCE.
  - Fixed compilation on DragonflyBSD due to no feature macro support
    in its standard C library (thanks to Markus Pfeiffer).

- Compiler
  - The scrutinizer no longer uses 'fixnum as the type for fixnums
    that might not fit into a fixnum on 32-bit architectures.

- Foreign function interface
  - Correctly calculate memory requirements of Scheme objects produced
    from foreign types with "const" qualifiers, avoiding memory
    corruption (#1424, thanks to Vasilij Schneidermann and Lemonboy)
  - Do not read beyond temporary stack buffer, which could lead to
    a crash when returning from a foreign callback (#1428).

4.12.0

- Security fixes
  - CVE-2016-6830: Fix buffer overrun due to excessively long argument
    or environment lists in process-execute and process-spawn (#1308).
    This also removes unnecessary limitations on the length of
    these lists (thanks to Vasilij Schneidermann).
  - CVE-2016-6831: Fix memory leak in process-execute and
    process-spawn.  If, during argument and environment list
    processing, a list item isn't a string, an exception is thrown,
    in which case previously malloc()ed strings weren't freed.
  - CVE-2016-9954: Irregex has been updated to 0.9.6, which fixes
    an exponential explosion in compilation of nested "+" patterns.

- Compiler:
  - define-constant now correctly keeps symbol values quoted.
  - Warnings are now emitted when using vector-{ref,set!} or one
    of take, drop, list-ref or list-tail with an out of range index
    for vectors and proper lists of a definitely known length.
  - The scrutinizer will no longer drop knowledge of the length of a
    vector.  It still drops types of its contents (which may be mutated).
  - Fixed incorrect argvector restoration after GC in directly
    recursive functions (#1317).
  - "Direct" procedure invocations now also maintain debug info (#894).

- Syntax expander
  - DSSSL lambda lists have improved hygiene, so they don't need
    the chicken or scheme modules to be imported in full (#806).
  - The let-optionals* macro no longer needs "quote", "car" and "cdr"
    to be imported and bound to their default values (#806).

- Runtime system:
  - C_locative_ref has been deprecated in favor of C_a_i_locative_ref,
    which is faster because it is inlined (#1260, thanks to Kooda).
  - The default error handler now truncates very long condition
    messages (thanks to Lemonboy).
  - Weak symbol GC (-:w) no longer drops random symbols (#1173).
  - The number of arguments to procedures, both via "apply" and direct
    invocation, are now limited only by the C stack size (#1098).
  - "time" macro now shows peak memory usage (#1318, thanks to Kooda).
  - Avoid crashes in ffi callbacks after GC (#1337, thanks to cosarara).

- Core libraries:
  - Irregex has been updated to 0.9.5, which fixes matching of all "bow"
    occurrances beyond the first with irregex-fold (upstream issue #14).
  - Keywords are more consistently read/written, like symbols (#1332).
  - SRFI-39: When jumping out of a parameterized dynamic extent,
    "parameterize" now remember the actual values, so when jumping back
    in, they are restored (fixes #1336, thanks to Joo ChurlSoo).
    This was a regression caused by the fix for #1227.

- Tools:
  - "chicken-install"
    - When installing eggs in deploy mode with "-keep-installed", eggs
      under the prefix won't unnecessarily be reinstalled (#1144).
    - Added new option "-no-install-deps" which inhibits automatic
      installation of dependencies, useful with "-prefix" (#1298).


4.11.0

- Security fixes
  - Specialisation rules for string-{ref,set!}, bit-set?
    and move-memory no longer use unchecked C functions which could
    result in undefined behaviour, including buffer overruns (#1216).

- Platform support
  - CHICKEN now supports the Linux X32 ABI (thanks to Sven Hartrumpf).

- Tools
  - Feathers now has a more neutral color scheme and larger font size.
  - With the -dir option, feathers can now correctly find source code.

- Runtime system:
  - The calling convention of CPS procedures has been changed to
    use "argument vectors" instead of C calling convention.
  - The C API of C_values(), C_do_apply() and how to invoke CPS
    functions has changed.  The C_procN() macros have disappeared.
    The manual example in "Accessing external objects" for C_values
    has been updated.  See also the "numbers" egg for examples on
    how to support pre- and post-4.10.1 CHICKENs simultaneously.
  - Apply hack is no longer used; the limitation of 128 arguments
    has been lifted for platforms which had no apply hack.
  - Increased the "binary compatibility version" to 8.
  - Delivery of signals in other OS-level threads is now dealt with
    in a more robust way (#1232) (thanks to Joerg Wittenberger).
  - Compiled programs with large literals won't crash on startup (#1221).
  - Comparisons of closures now behave in a stable way, whether or not
    the code was compiled with the -no-lambda-info option (#1041).
  - The signal handling code can no longer trigger "stack overflow" or
    "recursion too deep or circular data encountered" errors (#1283).

- Compiler:
  - Specializations on implicit "or" types like "number" or "boolean" now
    work, removing the requirement for the inferred types to match
    declared types exactly.  Specializations are matched from first to
    last to resolve ambiguities (#1214).
  - Compiler rewrites for char{<,>,<=,>=,=}? are now safe (#1122).
  - When requesting to emit import libraries that don't exist, the
     compiler now gives an error instead of quietly continuing (#1188).
  - Don't silently truncate huge literals (thanks to Claude Marinier).

- Core libraries
  - try-compile from setup-api cleans up temporary output files (#1213).
  - SRFI-18: thread-join! no longer gives an error when passed a
    thread in the "sleeping" state (thanks to Joerg Wittenberger)
  - SRFI-18: mutex-lock! will not set ownership of mutexes when

    locking fails for timeout and not keep the last thread which held
    a mutex until the next lock (thanks to Joerg Wittenberger).

    regular-file?, symbolic-link?, block-device?, character-device?
    fifo? and socket?.
  - Unit "posix": When "file-close" is interrupted it will retry,
    to avoid leaking descriptors (thanks to Joerg Wittenberger).

  - "chicken-status"
    - -prefix and -deploy options were added, matching chicken-install.
  - The -sudo and -s options for chicken-install and chicken-uninstall
    now honor a "SUDO" environment variable (thanks to Timo Myyrä).

- Syntax expander
  - Mixed internal define/define-values are now correctly ordered, so
    later defines can refer to earlier define-values (#1274).

    (thanks to Florian Zumbiehl)
  - CVE-2013-2024: On *nix, the qs procedure now single-quotes everything
    instead of relying on a blacklist of shell characters to be escaped.
    On Windows, it properly duplicates double-quote characters.  (thanks

  - CVE-2013-2075: Use POSIX poll() in other places where select() was
    still being used.  (thanks to Florian Zumbiehl and Joerg Wittenberger)
  - CVE-2012-6122: Use POSIX poll() on systems where available.  This avoids a

    from bevuta IT GmbH)
  - Added support for 64-bit Windows (consult the "README" file for more
    information).

- Runtime system
  - finalizers on constants are ignored in compiled code because compiled

  - On systems that provide sigprocmask(2), segmentation violations, illegal
    instruction signals, bus errors and floating-point exceptions are now caught

    - added "-oi"/"-ot" options as alternatives to "-emit-inline-file"
       and "-emit-type-file", respectively; "-n" has been deprecated.
    - .c/.o files are no longer overwritten when they have the same basename
      as a Scheme source file (i.e. "csc foo.scm foo.c -o foo" works now).
  - "chicken-install"
    - "-deploy" now correctly installs dependencies of
      deployed eggs under the deployment directory instead of globally.
    - Full URI syntax is now supported for proxy environment variables
      (thanks to Michele La Monaca)

      and "required-chicken-version" procedures.

- Syntax
  - Added the aliases "&optional" and "&rest" as alternatives to "#!optional"
    and "#!rest" in type-declarations (suggested by Joerg Wittenberger).
  - Vectors, SRFI-4 number vectors and blobs are now self-evaluating for
     R7RS compatibility.  Being literal constants, they are implicitly quoted.
  - For R7RS compatibility, named character literals #\escape and #\null are
     supported as aliases for #\esc and #\nul.  WRITE will output R7RS names.
  - The CASE form accepts => proc syntax, like COND (as specified by R7RS).
  - letrec* was added for R7RS compatibility.  Plain letrec no longer behaves
    like letrec*.

- Compiler
  - the "inline" declaration does not force inlining anymore as recursive
    inlining could lead to non-termination of the compiler (thanks to
    Andrei Barbu).
  - Type-analysis ("scrutiny") is enabled by default now, unless
    "-optimize-level 0" or "-no-usual-integrations" is given.
  - The "-scrutinize" compiler option has been deprecated.
  - A new lightweight flow-analysis pass ("lfa2") has been added.
    Enable by passing the "-lfa2" option to the compiler.
  - The deprecated options "-disable-warning", "-heap-growth", "-heap-shrinkage"
    and "-heap-initial-size" have been removed.
  - Removed the deprecated "constant" declaration.

    more informative.
  - Unused references to variables that name intrinsics can be removed.
  - In the flow-analysis pass, matching of combinations of "list"/"list-of" and
    "or" types with has been made more reliable.
  - Fixed various bugs in the type database.

- Syntax expander
  - added "require-extension-for-syntax" and "use-for-syntax".
  - Extended syntactic definitions are now available by default in all
    evaluated code, particularly in code evaluated at runtime in compiled
    applications.
  - Removed the deprecated variant "(define-compiler-syntax (NAME . LLIST) BODY ...)"
    of "define-compiler-syntax".

- C API
  - Deprecated C_get_argument[_2] and C_get_environment_variable[_2] functions.
  - Removed the deprecated "__byte_vector" type.

    for testing/debugging.
  - CVE-2012-6124: On 64-bit machines the "random" procedure no longer
    truncates result values (which caused very nonrandom results for very

    now used for performing type-sensitive optimizations of calls to
    most of the core-library procedures
  - deprecated the "constant" declaration specifier

    was unreliable and unmaintainable; the "-unboxing" compiler option will
    still be accepted but will produce a warning
  - Peter Bex contributed an optimization to the analysis pass that 
    greatly reduces compile time for source code containing deeply nested
    lexical bindings
  - procedures that are known to have the value of a core library procedure
    that is a "standard" or "extended binding" will be inlined
  - enhanced line number tracking to get better error messages from
    the scrutinizer.

    number on 64-bit architectures but can be 56 bits.
  - string-comparison handles embedded '\0' characters.
  - numerical predicates handle infinity and NaN correctly.
  - deprecated "[+-]nan", "[+-]inf" and other notations "accidentally"
    accepted by CHICKEN due to the underlying C library's strtod() function,
    standardizing on "[+-]nan.0" and "[+-]inf.0" from R6RS (and soon R7RS),
    when displaying numbers only these forms are generated now.
  - signals are queued to some extent and the interrupt handling has
    been cleaned up somewhat
  - the interpreter handles SIGINT directly - loading the "posix" unit
    is not needed anymore to handle this feature

    and "-heap-shrinkage"
  - the assembly-language stub routine for the implementation of "apply"
    was broken for Sparc64 systems and has been disabled for this platform
  - signal masks were accidentally reset upon GC for some platforms; use
    sigsetjmp/siglongjmp on BSD, Linux, MacOS X and Haiku

  - Extended syntax of "module" for aliasing and functor-instantiation
  - the "scheme" module has been integrated into the core library and
    is not installed as a separate import library anymore

  - locatives are allowed as arguments declared "c-pointer"
  - "int32" was not properly detected as a valid foreign type (thanks
    to Jim Ursetto)


4.7.0

- Build system
  - On BSD, libchicken.so is linked with -lpthread, as this seems
    to be required for linking libraries that require pthreads
  - The C header-files are now installed in a subdirectory below
    the "PRFIX/include" directory to allow installation of multiple
    chickens with different PROGRAM_PREFIX/PROGRAM_SUFFIX settings
    in the same prefix; to avoid conflicts with existing CHICKEN
    headers, it is recommended to completely remove any old
    installation before installing the new version
  - the PROGRAM_PREFIX and PROGRAM_SUFFIX configuration settings
    are applied to generated files and directories which allows
    perform differently named installations into the same PREFIX
  - increaded binary-compatibility version from 5 to 6, which
    means installed extensions in an existing installations will 
    have to be re-installed
  - bugfixes in mingw/msys makefiles
  - Sven Hartrumpf contributed a bugfix to the internal helper
    script for creating distribution directories

      non-list argument
    - fixed bug in `getter-with-setter' that modified the first
      argument if it already had a setter procedure attached
    - fixed incorrect size of internal data vector used in `time'
      (thanks to Kon Lovett)

    warning
  - When "-scrutinize" is given, installed ".types" files will be

  - Fixed optimizer bug in handling of "let" forms with multiple
    bindings which could result in toplevel assignments being
    silently dropped (reported by Moritz Heidkamp)

    modules now also shows the name of the procedure where the
    identifier is referenced (suggested by Alaric Snell-Pym)

  - Documented remaining "c...r" standard procedures (thanks to 
    Juergen Lorenz)

  - `define-record' now allows defining SRFI-17 setter procedures
    for accessing slots
  - the expansion of DSSSL lambda-lists uses now `let-optionals*'

    faster and more compact code for argument-list destructuring
    (thanks to Alan Post)

  `chicken-scheme-to-objc' ar compile-time
- fixed bug in expansion of `#!key' parameters in lambda-lists
- debug-output for forcing finalizers on exit goes to stderr now
  (thanks to Joerg Wittenberger)
- the installation routines for extensions automatically add
  version-number information if none is given in the extension

  output instead of throwing an error to avoid endless recursion when
  an error message is printed
- a feature identifier named `chicken-MAJOR.MINOR' is now defined 
  to simplify conditionalization of code on the CHICKEN version

  option and declaration
- usage of unimported syntax in modules gives more usable
  error messages; in particular, used but unimported FFI forms are 
  now detected
- invalid syntactic forms (mostly `()') encountered by the compiler
  or interpreter show the contextual form containing the expression,
  or, if indicated by the context warns about missing imports
- simplified manual pages of all core tools - they now refer to
  the output shown by invoking `<tool> -help'

  evaluation order of the arguments and does a better job
  at detecting non-list arguments (thanks to Jim Ursetto)
- `void' now takes arbitrary arguments and ignores them
- deprecated `noop' (from the `data-structures' unit) which
  is now replaced by `void'
- the `time' macro now performs a major garbage collection

  by `(current-error-port)' instead of the standard output
  port
- definitions of the form `(define define ...)' and
  `(define-syntax define-syntax ...)' now trigger an error,
  as required by R5RS (thanks to Jeronimo Pellegrini and Alex
  Shinn)

  is identical to `randomize'
- added new procedure `create-temporary-directory' to the
  `files' unit

  `make-pathname'
- slightly improved the performance of keyword argument
  processing

  allows redefinition and shadowing of all Scheme core forms
- faster implementations of `get' and `put!'
- faster implementation of `assq' in unsafe mode
- the `-sx' option prefixes each output line with `;'
- slightly better expansion performance
- more documentation of the C API (thanks to Peter Bex)

  to a file to be included as the module body
- added runtime option `-:G' to force GUI mode (on platforms
  that distinguish between GUI and non-GUI applications)
- removed the unsafe runtime library (`libuchicken'), this
  simplifies and speeds up the build and reduces the risk
  of executables loading library units from different
  variants of the runtime system
- removed the `-unsafe-libraries' option from `chicken'
  and `csc'
- removed bootstrapping target and bootstrapping files from
  development repository; to bootstrap the system, either
  use a release or development-snapshot tarball or fetch
  a statically linked precompiled `chicken' binary from
  http://chicken.wiki.br/chicken-projects/bootstrap/
- Jim Ursetto provided some fixes for building universal
  binaries on Mac OS X
- `csc' now compiles and links Windows resource (.rc) files
  when given on the command line
- `chicken-install' and `chicken-uninstall' have an embedded
  manifest that suppresses the elevation dialog on Windows
  Vista and later when UAC is activated (Thanks to Thomas Chust)
- the `install' program is not used in the build on mingw
  and mingw/MSYS platforms, since this is broken on older
  mingw versions
- line-number-information is now properly handled (in the
  few places where it is used) correctly for included files;
  the source file is given in trace-output in addition to
  the line number
- removed compiler warning for shared objects compiled in
  unsafe mode
- unboxing is now only done in unsafe mode
- in unsafe mode, pointer-accessors from the `lolevel' unit
  are now handled intrinsically by the compiler
- `chicken-install' accepts now relative pathnames for the
  `-prefix' option
- `define-record-type' now optionally allows using SRFI-17
  setters as record-field modifiers
- `integer?' returns `#f' for NaN and infinite numbers
- `csc' now has an `-no-elevation' option for embedding a
  manifest that prevents the elevation dialog on Windows
  Vista and later when IAC is activated
- the `,d' csi command displays qualified symbols properly
- symbols starting with the `#\#' character trigger an
  error when encountered by the reader
- Unit posix: `glob->regexp' now always returns a regular
  expression object or optionally an SRE
- Unit posix: `terminal-port?' and `terminal-size' have been
   implemented for Windows, the latter always returns `0 0',
  though (thanks to Jim Ursetto)
- Unit regex: `regexp' now accepts a regular expression
  object as argument
- Unit regex: removed `glob?'
- fixed bug in `chicken-install'/`chicken-uninstall' and
  `chicken-status' that prevented collapsed command-line
  options to be handled correctly.
- disabled runpath-fix for deployed applications for netbsd
  (but resurrected providing a runpath at all, thanks to 
  Peter Bex)
- Peter Bex provided documentation for the `C_closure' C API
  function

4.4.0

- the system can now be built with llvm-gcc and/or "clang" (the
  LLVM C compiler which doesn't use the GNU C frontend)
- added new option `-trunk' to `chicken-install', which forces
  building and installing the development version of extensions
  in combination with `-t local'
- added new option `-deploy' to `chicken-install', which builds
  extension for use in "deployed" applications (see below)
- added option `-deploy' to `csc', the compiler driver. With this
  option `csc' can build fully self-contained application bundles
  and double-clickable Macintosh GUI apps; see the "Deployment"
  manual chapter for more information
- the directory given to the `-prefix' option of `chicken-install'
  may now be a relative pathname.
- removed GUI-specific runtime library (`libchicken-gui') from
  Windows build - GUI- and non-GUI applications now use the same
  runtime library
- special forms of the foreign-function interface have been replaced
  with an internal form and syntax to allow renaming and shadowing of
  these forms
- the new `-private-repository' option in `csc' compiles executables
  with the extension-repository path set to the directory from which
  the program was started
- `csc': deprecated the `-W' and `-windows' options, added `-gui' as
  a platform-independent replacement

- user-defined extension-specifiers and `set-extension-specifier!'
  have been removed
- `delete-file[*]', `rename-file', `create-directory', `file-copy',
  `file-move', `delete-directory' and `change-directory' return their
  argument/destination filename on success
- added the missing procedure `condition-variable-name' to the
  srfi-18 library unit (Thanks to Joerg Wittenberger)
- the `glob?' function from the `regex' unit has been deprecated
- added the procedure `scan-input-lines' to the `utils' library unit
- added new runtime option `-:g' which enables GC debugging output
- reclamation of unused symbols in "symbol-gc" mode (`-:w') now only
  takes place for symbols with an empty property-list

  will fail and produce an error message when the loading executable
  is linked with a different runtime system
- on Windows, GUI libraries were not correctly linked by `csc'
- unit posix: added setter for `file-modification-time'
- the banner shows the branchname of the build, unless it's "master"
- the `-no-install' option to `chicken-install' is ignored when
  building/installing dependencies
- `chicken-uninstall' takes a glob instead of a regular expression as
  argument

- previous assignments to a toplevel variable that are separated by
  side effect free expressions are removed
- fixed windows version of `find-files' (thanks to Jim Ursetto)
- documentation for extensions is not installed automatically by
  `chicken-install' anymore
- changed binary version from "4" to "5", because the new runtime
  libraries are not binary-compatible with previous releases; this
  means all eggs have to be reinstalled and existing programs be
  recompiled!
- added unboxing pass to compiler which results in partially dramatical
  performance improvements for unsafe floating-point-intensive code;
  unboxing is enabled on optimization levels 4 and 5
- removed rest-argument-vector optimization as it could conflict
  with inlining (thanks to Sven Hartrumpf)
- renamed `pointer-offset' to `pointer+' and deprecated `pointer-offset'

- added support for a make(1) configuration file ("config.make")
- `chicken-install' now allows specifiying a proxy for retrieving
  extensions over HTTP (thanks to Nicolas Pelletier)
- fixed bug in `cond-expand' that incorrectly renamed feature-identifiers
  if the form was the product of a syntax expansion (reported by Thomas
  Bushnell)
- import-libraries are only generated by the compiler if they don't exist
  yet and if the content has actually changed (this simplifies makefile-
  rules in some cases)
- it is now possible to pass a config-file to `make(1)' instead of specifying
  all build-options as variables on the command-line (see README)
- removed compiler options for "benchmark-mode" and replaced them with a
  new optimization level (5) (note that `-O5' does not imply fixnum mode
  anymore)
- `hen.el' and `scheme-complete.el' are not bundled with the core system
  anymore - `hen.el' is currently not maintained, and `scheme-complete.el'
  has its own release cycle; both files are available, see
  http://chicken.wiki.br/emacs
- removed meaningless benchmark suite and cleaned up
- added optional argument to `grep' that allows applying a function
  to each matched item (contributed by Tony Sidaway)
- added extension-property `import-only', which makes it possible to
  create extensions that have no runtime part
- the argument to `seconds->string', `seconds->utc-time' and 
  `seconds->local-time' is now optional and defaults to the value
  of `(current-seconds)' (suggested by Mario Goulart)
- removed read-syntax for `syntax' form
- fixed bug in `get-condition-property'
- fixed bug in windows version of `process-execute'
- TCP timeouts throw exception of kind `timeout' to allow
  distinguishing between timeouts and other errors
- removed some internal functions that manipulate environments
- fixed bugs in `standard-extension' (`setup-api' module) and added keyword 
  arguments for building static extensions and adding custom properties
- when cross-compiling, `chicken-install(1)' doesn't pass `-setup-mode'
  (the host tools should not attempt to load target binaries)
- `installation-prefix' in the `setup-api' module was not always correctly
  set
- the `-force' option in `chicken-install(1)' overrides the CHICKEN version
  check
- disabled e-mail feature in `chicken-bug(1)', since it doesn't work
  anyway, in the moment
- fixed bug in `reexport' that made it impossible to reexport core library
  definitions
