Deprecated functions and variables
==================================

5.1.1

- ##sys#check-exact and its C implementations C_i_check_exact and
  C_i_check_exact_2 have been deprecated (see also #1631).
- "C_u_i_zerop" has been turned into an inline operation and is
  deprecated in favor of "C_u_i_zerop2".
- The define-record-printer macro has been deprecated in favour of
  record-printer and set-record-printer! procedures, and a SRFI-17
  setter for the former.


5.0.0

- "bit->boolean" has been introduced temporarily to avoid users
  having to figure out why "bit-set?" uses a different argument
  order than the procedure with the same name that is specified in
  SRFI-33 and SRFI-60. This procedure will be replaced by the proper
  "bit-set?" in one of the next versions, together with a C level
  macro or function.

  "bit->boolean" expands into "C_u_i_bit_to_bool", "C_i_bit_to_bool"
  or "C_i_fixnum_bit_to_bool", which are all deprecated as well,
  but might be re-used in a future version of "bit-set?".
