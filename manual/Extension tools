== Extension tools

The basic tools to install, uninstall and view "eggs" and the extensions
are {{chicken-install}}, {{chicken-uninstall}} and {{chicken-status}}.

{{chicken-install}} can be used in two modes: first, as a simple package
manager that downloads publicly available eggs (and their dependencies, if
necessary) and compiles the contained extensions, installing them on 
a user's system.

For development of eggs, {{chicken-install}} can also be invoked
without arguments, in a directory that contains an egg specification
file and the associated source code, building all components and
installing them.

{{chicken-status}} simply lists installed eggs, the contained extensions,
and optionally the files that where installed with a particular egg.

Below you will find a description of the available command line options
for all three programs. A specification of the egg description file
format is [[Egg specification format|here]].

=== Security

When eggs are downloaded and installed one is executing code
from potentially compromised systems. This applies also when
{{chicken-install}} executes system tests for required eggs. As
the code has been retrieved over the network effectively untrusted
code is going to be evaluated. When {{chicken-install}} is run as
''root'' the whole system is at the mercy of the build instructions
(note that this is also the case every time you install software via
{{sudo make install}}, so this is not specific to the CHICKEN
egg mechanism).

Security-conscious users should never run {{chicken-install}} as root.
A simple remedy is to keep the repository inside a user's home
directory (see the section "Changing repository location" below).
Alternatively obtain write/execute access to the default location of the repository
(usually {{/usr/local/lib/chicken}}) to avoid running as
root. {{chicken-install}} also provides a {{-sudo}} option to perform
the last installation steps as root user, but do building and other
.setup script processing as normal. A third solution is to 
override {{VARDIR}} when building the system
(for example by passing {{"VARDIR=/foo/bar"}} on the make command line,
or by modifying {{config.make}}. Eggs will then be installed in
{{$(VARDIR)/chicken/8}}.

=== Changing the repository location

When CHICKEN is installed a repository for eggs is created and initialized
in a default location (usually something like {{/usr/local/lib/chicken/9/}}).
It is possible to keep an egg repository in another location. This can be
configured at build-time by passing {{VARDIR=<directory>}} to {{make(3)}}
or by modifying the {{config.make}} configuration file. If you want to
override this location after chicken is installed, you can create a
repository directory, set the
{{CHICKEN_INSTALL_REPOSITORY}} and/or {{CHICKEN_REPOSITORY_PATH}}
environment variables to the full path of the new reopsitory and copy all files
from the default repository into the new one.

Note that your binary version can differ from the one given in 
the examples here, if your
chicken version is older or newer than the one used in these examples.
Check your default location for the correct binary-version number.

{{CHICKEN_REPOSITORY_PATH}} is a directory (or a list of directories
separated by {{:}}/{{;}}) where eggs are to be
loaded from for all chicken-based programs. {{CHICKEN_INSTALL_REPOSITORY}}
is the place where eggs will be installed and which the egg-related
tools like {{chicken-install}}, {{chicken-uninstall}} and
{{chicken-status}} consult and update. Make sure the paths given in these 
environment variables are absolute and not relative.

=== Static linking

Static linking of extensions and programs is fully supported and
should be transparent to the user. Every extension will by
default be compiled into a dynamically loadable and a statically
linkable entity. By passing {{-static}} on the {{csc}} command-line,
eggs that are available in static form will be linked instead of
the dynamically loadable version. Use the {{linkage}} egg
description property to select in what modes a component should
be built.

To identify the necessary object files during linking of 
extensions, {{csc}}
creates so-called "link files" and installs them along the
statically compiled object file in the local egg repository.
These link files specify what objects should be linked when
an application is using a static variant of an extension.


=== Locations

For experimentation or in-house builds of software it may be
useful to have private egg repositories in addition to the
official CHICKEN egg repository. This can be accomplished by
defining so-called "locations", directories that contain egg
source-code and description files and which should be scanned
before trying to retrieve an egg via the network.

The file {{<PREFIX>/share/chicken/setup.defaults}} holds various
parameters that define where eggs should be downloaded, together
with more obscure options, and can be used to customize the
sources where eggs will be retrieved from. Adding a line of 
the form

{{(location "<PATH>")}}

will add {{<PATH>}} as an additional egg source, where {{<PATH>}}
should be a directory in the local filesystem that contains
any number of eggs, one directory for each, including the source code
and the {{.egg}} files for each egg.

Locations are searched before trying to retrieve from the network.
Any number of locations may be defined.


=== The egg cache

Eggs are downloaded and built in the so called "egg cache", an
intermediate location used for storing already downloaded source code
and for providing a temporary location for building the eggs before
they are installed.

By default the cache is located in the directory
{{.chicken-install.cache}} is the user's home directory ({{$HOME}} on
UNIX, or {{%USERPROFILE%}} on Windows. If the respective environment
variable is not set, then {{/tmp}} or {{/Temp}} is used.

Built extensions and programs remain in the cache, to avoid rebuilding
already compiled code and multiple downloads of eggs in case the
installation of an egg fails - the dependencies will be cached after
the first download and re-download is not needed.

{{chicken-install}} tries to take extreme care to avoid stale binaries,
but should you be in doubt, simply delete the directory, or run
{{chicken-install -purge}} to clear the cache or parts of it.

You can override the location of the cache by setting the
{{CHICKEN_EGG_CACHE}} environment variable.


=== Egg installation in detail

==== Retrieval

First the egg names given on the command line (or, if no arguments
are given, all eggs identified by {{.egg}} files in the current 
directory, including any in a subdirectory named {{chicken}})
must be retrieved, either from a local source or from the official
egg repository. Should the egg exist in the egg cache we check
whether this cached version is out of date. A cached egg is 
considered out of date, if a) it is locally available and all cached
files belonging to the egg do not have newer timestamps than the
local files, or b) if it is a remotely retrieved egg and no
newer versions exist on the remote egg server and the last time
the cache was filled from the remote location is not later than
one hour. Additionally, if any changes in certain environment
variables that may influence the compilation of an egg, or if
the CHICKEN version changed, then retrieval of the egg sources
is enforced in any case.

If the egg is in the current directory, or in
a "location" (as described above), the files are copied into
the cache. If the egg is remotely available, then it is retrieved
via HTTP from one of the egg servers defined in {{setup.defaults}}.

Once the egg sources are retrieved and stored in the cache,
their {{.egg}} files are loaded and validated. After this
any egg dependencies are resolved and located in the cache,
triggering a recursive retrieval, if necessary.

==== Preparation

Unless the {{-retrieve}} option was given, the eggs intended
to be built and installed are now scheduled for compilation.
The egg information from the {{.egg}} files is processed and
translated into build and install scripts for the current
platform - if this CHICKEN was configured for cross compilation,
and no separate host- or target-build was selected, two sets
of build/install scripts will be generated, one for the host
system and one for the target.

==== Building and installation

Unless {{-dry-run}} was given on the command-line, the build-
and install scripts are now executed, ordered by the dependency
relationships between the full set of eggs that are scheduled
for compilation. If the {{-test}} option was given and a file named
{{run.scm}} exists in the {{tests}} subdirectory of the egg
sources, then this script is executed. Should it terminate with
an error or a non-zero exit code, the installation is still performed
and {{chicken-install}} does not abort. Only after all scheduled
eggs have been installed, {{chicken-install}} will terminate
with a non-zero exit code.

Note that the build process attempts to minimize re-building
of already compiled files in the cache, using the {{chicken-do}}
program. See the manual page for {{chicken-do}} for more details.

From the egg-information in the {{.egg}} file, the set of files
installed for a particular egg are added to the egg-information
and stored together with the build-artifacts produced by the
build scripts.

{{chicken-install}} recognizes the {{SUDO}}, {{http_proxy}} and {{proxy_auth}} environment variables, if set.

When running {{chicken-install}} with an argument {{NAME}}, for which
no associated {{.egg}} file exists, then it will try to download the
extension via HTTP from the CHICKEN code repository at
[[http://code.call-cc.org/svn/chicken-eggs/]]. Extensions that are
required to compile and/or use the requested extension are downloaded
and installed automatically.
