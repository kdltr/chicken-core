== Module (chicken file)

This module provides various generic operations on files and
directories.  For more specific operations, see also
[[Module (chicken file posix)]].

All errors related to failing file-operations will signal a condition
of kind {{(exn i/o file)}}.

=== Basic file operations

==== create-directory

<procedure>(create-directory NAME #!optional PARENTS?)</procedure>

Creates a directory with the pathname {{NAME}}.  If the {{PARENTS?}} argument
is given and not false, any nonexistent parent directories are also created.

Notice that if {{NAME}} exists, {{create-directory}} won't try to create it
and will return {{NAME}} (i.e., it won't raise an error when given a {{NAME}}
that already exists).

==== copy-file

<procedure>(copy-file ORIGFILE NEWFILE #!optional CLOBBER BLOCKSIZE)</procedure>

Copies {{ORIGFILE}} (a string denoting some filename) to {{NEWFILE}},
{{BLOCKSIZE}} bytes at a time.  {{BLOCKSIZE}} defaults to 1024, and
must be a positive integer.  Returns the number of bytes copied on
success, or errors on failure.  {{CLOBBER}} determines the behaviour
of {{file-copy}} when {{NEWFILE}} is already extant.  When set to
{{#f}} (default), an error is signaled.  When set to any other value,
{{NEWFILE}} is overwritten.  {{file-copy}} will work across
filesystems and devices and is not platform-dependent.

==== move-file

<procedure>(move-file ORIGFILE NEWFILE #!optional CLOBBER BLOCKSIZE)</procedure>

Moves {{ORIGFILE}} (a string denoting some filename) to {{NEWFILE}},
with the same semantics as {{copy-file}}, above.  {{move-file}} is
safe across filesystems and devices (unlike {{rename-file}}).  It is
possible for an error to be signaled despite partial success if
{{NEWFILE}} could be created and fully written but removing
{{ORIGFILE}} fails.

If {{CLOBBER}} is given and not {{#f}}, {{NEWFILE}} will be replaced
when it already exists, otherwise an error is signaled.

The {{BLOCKSIZE}} argument indicates the block size to use when
copying the file a block at a time.  It must be a positive integer,
and it defaults to 1024.

==== delete-file

<procedure>(delete-file STRING)</procedure>

Deletes the file with the pathname {{STRING}}. If the file does
not exist, an error is signaled.

==== delete-file*

<procedure>(delete-file* STRING)</procedure>

If the file with pathname {{STRING}} exists, it is deleted and {{#t}}
is returned.  If the file does not exist, nothing happens and {{#f}}
is returned.

==== delete-directory

<procedure>(delete-directory NAME [RECURSIVE])</procedure>

Deletes the directory with the pathname {{NAME}}. If {{RECURSIVE}} is
not given or false, then the directory has to be empty.

==== directory

<procedure>(directory [PATHNAME [SHOW-DOTFILES?]])</procedure>

Returns a list with all files that are contained in the directory with the name {{PATHNAME}}
(which defaults to the value of {{(current-directory)}}).
Files beginning with {{.}} are included only if {{SHOW-DOTFILES?}} is given and not {{#f}}.

==== directory-exists?

<procedure>(directory-exists? STRING)</procedure>

Returns {{STRING}} if a directory with the given pathname exists, or
{{#f}} otherwise.


==== file-exists?

<procedure>(file-exists? STRING)</procedure>

Returns {{STRING}} if a file or directory with the given pathname exists, or
{{#f}} otherwise.


==== rename-file

<procedure>(rename-file OLD NEW #!optional CLOBBER)</procedure>

Renames the file or directory with the pathname {{OLD}} to
{{NEW}}. If the operation does not succeed, an error is signaled.

If {{CLOBBER}} is given and not {{#f}}, {{NEW}} will be replaced when
it already exists, otherwise an error is signaled.

==== file-readable?
==== file-writable?
==== file-executable?

<procedure>(file-readable? FILENAME)</procedure><br>
<procedure>(file-writable? FILENAME)</procedure><br>
<procedure>(file-executable? FILENAME)</procedure>

These procedures return {{#t}} if the current user has read,
write or execute permissions on the file named {{FILENAME}}.


=== Temporary files and directories

==== create-temporary-file

<procedure>(create-temporary-file [EXTENSION])</procedure>

Creates an empty temporary file and returns its pathname. If
{{EXTENSION}} is not given, then {{.tmp}} is used. If the
environment variable {{TMPDIR, TEMP}} or {{TMP}} is set,
then the pathname names a file in that directory. If none of
the environment variables is given the location of the
temporary file defaults to {{/tmp}} if it exists or the 
current-directory


==== create-temporary-directory

<procedure>(create-temporary-directory)</procedure>

Creates an empty temporary directory and returns its pathname. If the
environment variable {{TMPDIR, TEMP}} or {{TMP}} is set, then the
temporary directory is created at that location.


=== Finding files

==== find-files

<procedure>(find-files DIRECTORY #!key test action seed limit dotfiles follow-symlinks)</procedure>

Recursively traverses the contents of {{DIRECTORY}} (which should be a
string) and invokes the procedure {{action}} for all files in which
the procedure {{test}} is true.

{{test}} may be a procedure of one argument or an irregex object,
regex string or SRE expression that will be matched with a full
pathname using {{irregex-match}}. {{test}} defaults to {{(constantly
#t)}}.


{{action}} should be a procedure of two arguments: the currently
encountered file and the result of the previous invocation of
{{action}}, or, if this is the first invocation, the value of
{{seed}}. {{action}} defaults to {{cons}}, {{seed}} defaults to {{()}}.

{{limit}} should be a procedure of one argument that is called for
each nested directory and which should return true, if that directory
is to be traversed recursively. {{limit}} may also be an exact integer
that gives the maximum recursion depth. For example, a depth of {{0}}
means that only files in the top-level, specified directory are to be
traversed. In this case, all nested directories are ignored.
{{limit}} may also be {{#f}} (the default), which is equivalent to
{{(constantly #t)}}.

If {{dotfiles}} is given and true, then files starting with a "{{.}}"
character will not be ignored (but note that "{{.}}" and "{{..}}"  are
always ignored). if {{follow-symlinks}} is given and true, then the
traversal of a symbolic link that points to a directory will
recursively traverse the latter. By default, symbolic links are not
followed.

Note that {{action}} is called with the full pathname of each file,
including the directory prefix.


==== glob

<procedure>(glob PATTERN1 ...)</procedure>

Returns a list of the pathnames of all existing files matching
{{PATTERN1 ...}}, which should be strings containing the usual
file-patterns (with {{*}} matching zero or more characters and
{{?}} matching zero or one character).
