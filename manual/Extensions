== Eggs

=== Extension libraries

Extension libraries (''eggs'') are extensions to the core
functionality provided by the basic CHICKEN system, to be built and
installed separately.  The mechanism for loading compiled extensions
is based on dynamically loadable code and as such is only available on
systems on which loading compiled code at runtime is
supported. Currently these are most UNIX-compatible platforms that
provide the {{libdl}} functionality like Linux, Solaris, BSD, Mac OS X
and Windows using Cygwin.

On systems where dynamic loading is not available, extensions can
still be built and linked as static object files.

Note: eggs may also be normal applications or shell scripts, but
are usually libraries.

Extensions are technically nothing but dynamically loadable compiled
files with added meta-data that describes dependencies to other
eggs, version information and things like the author/maintainer 
of the egg. Three tools provide an easy to use interface for
installing eggs, removing them and querying the current
status of installed eggs.


=== Installing eggs

To install an egg, run the {{chicken-install}} program
with the egg name as argument. The egg archive is
downloaded, its contents extracted and the contained egg description
file is analyzed and the appropriate commands executed. 
This file is an abstract description of the contents of
the egg and
will be translated by {{chicken-install}} into build- and installation
scripts for the current platform. After running these scripts (and
if all goes well), the egg is installed and will be available
like a built-in library. The format and meaning
of the file will be described below.

Installation will copy
a number of given files into the local egg repository or in the
path where the CHICKEN executables are located (in the case of
executable programs or scripts). Additionally the list of installed
files, and user-defined metadata is stored in the repository.

If no egg name is given on the command-line, then all {{.egg}}
files in the current directory are processed, including all {{.egg}}
files in a subdirectory {{chicken}} (if such a directory exists),
in some arbitrary
order, unless the egg descriptions specify dependencies.

==== Installing eggs that use libraries

Sometimes an egg requires a C library to compile. Compilation
can fail when your system has this library in a nonstandard
location. Normally the C compiler searches in the default locations
{{/usr}} and {{/usr/local}}, and in the prefix where CHICKEN itself
was installed. Sometimes this is not enough, so you'll need to supply
{{chicken-install}} with some extra hints to the C compiler/linker. Here's
an example:

  CSC_OPTIONS='-I/usr/pkg/include/mysql -L/usr/pkg/lib/mysql -L -R/usr/pkg/lib/mysql' chicken-install mysql

This installs the mysql egg with the extra compiler options -I and -L
to set the include path and the library search path. The second -L
switch passes the -R option directly to the linker, which causes the
library path to get hardcoded into the resulting extension file (for
systems that do not use {{ld.so.conf}}).

The environment variables {{CHICKEN_C_INCLUDE_PATH}} and {{CHICKEN_C_LIBRARY_PATH}}
can also be used to override include- and linker-paths. Each of these variables
may contain one or more directory names, separated by {{:}} or {{;}} and will
be passed using {{-I}} and {{-L}} to the C compiler.

=== Creating eggs

An egg can be created by placing its code and some special
files in a directory named after the desired name of the egg. 
For example, if your
egg is called {{foo}}, create a directory called {{foo}}
and put the egg code there.

Eggs need an egg description file {{<egg name>.egg}}.
This file indicates how
the egg is to be compiled and provides some information
about the egg (author, license, dependencies etc).

=== Format of the egg description file

An egg description is basically an association list holding
information about the components of the egg. An egg may contain
multiple components: libraries, programs, Scheme or C include files
and arbitrary data files. Dependencies between eggs can be
specified as can be dependencies between components of an egg.

A list of valid properties follows.

==== Global properties

===== version

[egg property] (version STRING)

Specifies version string for this egg. {{STRING}} should have
the format {{<MAJOR>.<MINOR>.<PATCHLEVEL>}}, where only the
{{<MAJOR>}} part is mandatory.

Eggs from remote egg servers are automatically versioned - the
version is part of the protocol to retrieve the egg and does not
have to be specified in the {{.egg}} file. Eggs installed from
local directories (see below) should explicitly specify a version.

===== synopsis

[egg property] (synopsis STRING)

Gives a short description of this egg.

===== author

[egg property] (author STRING)

Names the author or authors of the contained code.

===== maintainer

[egg property] (maintainer STRING)

Names the maintainer of this code, if different from author(s).

===== category

[egg property] (category NAME)

Gives the category under which this egg should be contained.
See [[/chicken-projects/egg-index-5.html|the egg index]]
for a list of currently used categories.

===== license

[egg property] (license STRING)

Names the license under which this code is available.

===== dependencies

[egg property] (dependencies EGG ...)

Lists eggs that this egg depends on, and which should be
built and installed if they do not already exist in the repository.
{{EGG}} should be whether a symbol or a list of the form
{{EGGNAME VERSION}}, where the former means to install the
newest available egg with this name and the latter specifies
a specific version or higher.

Note that this property
has a different meaning depending on whether it appears at
toplevel in an egg description or inside a component.

====== test-dependencies

[egg property] (test-dependencies EGG ...)

Lists eggs that are required for this egg to run the tests
(if tests exist.) This only has an effect if the {{-test}}
option has been given to {{chicken-install}}.

====== build-dependencies

[egg property] (build-dependencies EGG ...)

Lists eggs that are build-time dependencies for this egg,
i.e. there are required to build, but not to run the contained
code. Currently this is treated identical to {{dependencies}}.

====== foreign-dependencies

[egg property] (foreign-dependencies NAME ...)

Lists external dependencies like native code libraries
or system-specific packages and is currently only used for
documentation purposes.

====== platform

[egg property] (platform PLATFORM)

Specifies for which platform this egg is intended. {{PLATFORM}}
should be a symbol naming the target platform ({{windows}}, {{linux}}
or {{unix}}) or a boolean combination of platform values, allowed
are {{(not PLATFORM)}}, {{(or PLATFORM ...)}} and {{(and PLATFORM ...)}}.
If the expression can not be satisfied, then installation of this
egg will abort.

====== components

[egg property] (components COMPONENT ...)

Lists components (extensions, programs, include- or data files)
that this extension installs. See below for information on how
to specify component-specific information.

====== host

[egg property] (host PROP ...)

Recursively process {{PROP ...}}, but only for the host (build)
platform, in case this is a "cross-chicken", a CHICKEN installation
intended for cross compilation.

====== target

[egg property] (target PROP ...)

Recursively process {{PROP ...}}, but only for the target
platform, in case this is a "cross-chicken", a CHICKEN installation
intended for cross compilation.

===== Components

====== extension

[egg property] (extension NAME PROP ...)

Specifies an extension library component. The properties
{{PROP...}} are processed recursively and apply only to this
component.

====== data

[egg property] (data NAME PROP ...)

Specifies one or more arbitrary data files.

====== generated-source-file

[egg property] (generated-source-file NAME PROP ...)

Specifies a file that is generated during the process of building
the egg.

====== c-include

[egg property] (c-include NAME PROP ...)

Specifies one or more C include files.

====== scheme-include

[egg property] (scheme-include NAME PROP ...)

Specifies one or more Scheme include files.

====== program

[egg property] (program NAME PROP ...)

Specifies an executable program.

===== Component properties

====== host

[egg property] (host PROP ...)

Process {{PROP ...}} recursively for the current component, but
apply the properties only to the host (build) part, when using
a CHICKEN installation intended for cross-compilation.

====== target

[egg property] (target PROP ...)

Process {{PROP ...}} recursively for the current component, but
apply the properties only to the target part, when using
a CHICKEN installation intended for cross-compilation.

====== linkage

[egg property] (linkage LINKAGE)

Define whether the component should be linked dynamically or
statically. {{LINKAGE}} can be {{static}} or {{dynamic}}. This
property only makes sense for extension libraries.

====== types-file

[egg property] (types-file [NAME])

Specifies that a "type-database" file should be generated and
installed for this component. This property is only used for
extension libraries. The name is optional and defaults to the
name of the extensions (with the proper extension).

====== inline-file

[egg property] (inline-file [NAME])

Specifies that an "inline" file should be generated and installed
for this component. This property is only used for extension
libraries. The name is optional and defaults to the
name of the extensions (with the proper extension).

====== custom-build

[egg property] (custom-build STRING)

Specifies a custom build operation that should be executed
instead of the default build operations. This property is mandatory
for components of type {{generated-source-file}}. {{STRING}}
usually contains a shell command and thus may be platform sensitive.

====== csc-options

[egg property] (csc-options OPTION ...)

Specifies additional compiler options for {{csc}} that should be
used when building this component. If this property is not
given, the default options are used, which are {{-O2 -d1}}
for extensions and programs and {{-O2 -d0}} for import
libraries.

====== link-options

[egg property] (link-options OPTION ...)

Specifies additional link options for {{csc}} that should be
used when building this component.

====== source

[egg property] (source NAME)

Specifies an alternative source file, in case it has a name
distinct from the component name. By default the source file
for a component is named after the component, with the {{.scm}}
extension added.

====== install-name

[egg property] (install-name NAME)

Specifies an alternative installation name of the component,
if it differs from the actual component name. This property
is most useful if an egg installs an extension and a program
of the same name, but needs to distinguish the components during
build time.

====== dependencies

[egg property] (dependencies NAME ...)

Specifies dependencies between components. Note that this use
of the {{dependencies}} property is different from the property
of the same name that is used at the "global" level of the
egg description file.

====== destination

[egg property] (destination NAME)

Specifies an alternative installation destination for the
built component and only applies
to components of type {{data}}, {{c-include}} and {{scheme-include}}.
This property should only be used in extreme
cases, as it is recommended to use the default installation 
locations, which are:

* for C include files: {{<PREFIX>/include/chicken/}}

* for Scheme include files: {{<PREFIX>/share/chicken/}}

* for data files: {{<PREFIX>/share/chicken/}}

====== files

[egg property] (files NAME ...)

Specifies source files for this component and only applies
to components of type {{data}}, {{c-include}} and {{scheme-include}}.

=== Examples for extensions

==== A simple library

The simplest case is a single file that does not export any syntax. 
For example

<enscript highlight=scheme>
;;;; hello.scm

(define (hello name)
  (print "Hello, " name " !") )
</enscript>

We need an {{.egg}} file to build and install our nifty extension:

<enscript highlight=scheme>
;;;; hello.egg

((author "Me")
 (synopsis "A cool hello-world library")
 (license "GPLv3")
 (components (extension hello)))
</enscript>

After entering 

 $ chicken-install

at the shell prompt (and in the same directory where the two files
exist), the file {{hello.scm}} will be compiled into a dynamically
loadable library and a statically linkable object.
If the compilation succeeds, {{hello.so}} and {{hello.o}} will
be stored in the repository, together with a file named
{{hello.egg-info}} containing an a-list with metadata (what
you stored above in {{hello.egg}} plus some additional metadata).
If no extension name is given to {{chicken-install}}, it will simply
process the any files with the {{.egg}} extension it can find.

Use it like any other CHICKEN extension:

 $ csi -q
 #;1> (require-library hello)
 ; loading /usr/local/lib/chicken/8/hello.so ...
 #;2> (hello "me")
 Hello, me!
 #;3>

==== An application

Here we create a simple application:

<enscript highlight=scheme>
;;;; hello2.scm

(print "Hello, ")
(for-each (lambda (x) (printf "~A " x)) (command-line-arguments))
(print "!")
</enscript>

We also need an egg file:

;;;; hello2.egg

<enscript highlight=scheme>
((author "Me")
 (synopsis "A cool hello-world application")
 (license "proprietary")
 (components (program hello2)))
</enscript>

To use it, just run {{chicken-install}} in the same directory:

 $ chicken-install

(Here we omit the extension name)

Now the program {{hello2}} will be installed in the same location as
the other CHICKEN tools (like {{chicken}}, {{csi}}, etc.), which will
normally be {{/usr/local/bin}}.  Note that you need write-permissions
for those locations and may have to run {{chicken-install}} with
administrative rights or use the {{-sudo}} option.

The extension can be used from the command line:

 $ hello2 one two three
 Hello, 
 one two three !

De-installation is just as easy - use the {{chicken-uninstall}}
program to remove one or more extensions from the local repository:

 $ chicken-uninstall hello2

==== A module exporting syntax

The hello module was just a shared library, and not a module.

To create an extension that exports syntax see the chapter on
[[Modules]].  We will show a simple example here: a module {{my-lib}}
that exports one macro ({{prog1}}) and one procedure ({{my-sum}}):

<enscript highlight=scheme>
;;; my-lib.scm

(module my-lib
  *
  (import scheme chicken)

(define-syntax prog1
  (syntax-rules ()
    ((_ e1 e2 ...)
     (let ((result e1))
       (begin e2 ...)
       result))))

(define my-sum
  (lambda (numbers)
    (prog1
      (apply + numbers)
      (display "my-sum used one more time!")
      (newline))))

)
</enscript>

The {{prog1}} macro is similar to Common Lisp's {{prog1}}: it
evaluates a list of forms, but returns the value of the first form.

The egg file:

<enscript highlight=scheme>
;;; my-lib.egg

((components (extension my-lib))
 (version 1.0)
 (licence "BSD")
 (author "Me again")
 (synopsis "My own cool libraries"))
</enscript>

Running {{chicken-install}} on the same directory will install the extension.

Next, it should be possible to load the library:

 $ csi -q
 #;1> (import my-lib)
 ; loading /usr/local/lib/chicken/6/my-lib.import.so ...
 ; loading /usr/local/lib/chicken/6/scheme.import.so ...
 ; loading /usr/local/lib/chicken/6/chicken.import.so ...
 ; loading /usr/local/lib/chicken/6/my-lib.so ...
 #;2> (my-sum '(10 20 30))
 my-sum used one more time!
 60
 #;3> (my-sum '(-1 1 0))
 my-sum used one more time!
 0
 #;4> (prog1 (+ 2 2) (print "---"))
 ---

==== Notes on chicken-install

When running {{chicken-install}} with an argument {{NAME}}, for which
no associated {{.egg}} file exists, then it will try to download the
extension via HTTP from the CHICKEN code repository at
[[http://code.call-cc.org/svn/chicken-eggs/]]. Extensions that are
required to compile and/or use the requested extension are downloaded
and installed automatically.

To query the list of currently installed extensions, use
{{chicken-status}}. It can list what extensions are installed and
what files belong to a particular installed extension.

; {{-c   -components}} : list installed components


=== Security

When eggs are downloaded and installed one is executing code
from potentially compromised systems. This applies also when
{{chicken-install}} executes system tests for required eggs. As
the code has been retrieved over the network effectively untrusted
code is going to be evaluated. When {{chicken-install}} is run as
''root'' the whole system is at the mercy of the build instructions
(note that this is also the case every time you install software via
{{sudo make install}}, so this is not specific to the CHICKEN
egg mechanism).

Security-conscious users should never run {{chicken-install}} as root.
A simple remedy is to keep the repository inside a user's home
directory (see the section "Changing repository location" below).
Alternatively obtain write/execute access to the default location of the repository
(usually {{/usr/local/lib/chicken}}) to avoid running as
root. {{chicken-install}} also provides a {{-sudo}} option to perform
the last installation steps as root user, but do building and other
.setup script processing as normal. A third solution is to 
override {{VARDIR}} when building the system
(for example by passing {{"VARDIR=/foo/bar"}} on the make command line,
or by modifying {{config.make}}. Eggs will then be installed in
{{$(VARDIR)/chicken/8}}.

=== Changing the repository location

When CHICKEN is installed a repository for eggs is created and initialized
in a default location (usually something like {{/usr/local/lib/chicken/6/}}).
It is possible to keep an egg repository in another location. This can be
configured at build-time by passing {{VARDIR=<directory>}} to {{make(3)}}
or by modifying the {{config.make}} configuration file. If you want to
override this location after chicken is installed, you can create a
repository directory, set the
{{CHICKEN_INSTALL_REPOSITORY}} and/or {{CHICKEN_REPOSITORY_PATH}}
environment variables and copy all files
from the default repository into the new one.

Note that your binary version can differ from the one given in 
the examples here, if your
chicken version is older or newer than the one used in these examples.
Check your default location for the correct binary-version number.

{{CHICKEN_REPOSITORY_PATH}} is the place where eggs are to be
loaded from for all chicken-based programs. {{CHICKEN_INSTALL_REPOSITORY}}
is the place where eggs will be installed and which the egg-related
tools like {{chicken-install}}, {{chicken-uninstall}} and
{{chicken-status}} consult and update.


=== Static linking

Static linking of extensions and programs is fully supported and
should be transparent to the user. Every extension will by
default be compiled into a dynamically loadable and a statically
linkable entity. By passing {{-static}} on the {{csc}} command-line,
eggs that are available in static form will be linked instead of
the dynamically loadable version. Use the {{linkage}} egg
description property to select in what modes a component should
be built.

To identify the necessary object files during linking of 
extensions, {{csc}}
creates so-called "link files" and installs them along the
statically compiled object file in the local egg repository.
These link files specify what objects should be linked when
an application is using a static variant of an extension.


=== Locations

For experimentation or in-house builds of software it may be
useful to have private egg repositories in addition to the
official CHICKEN egg repository. This can be accomplished by
defining so-called "locations", directories that contain egg
source-code and description files and which should be scanned
before trying to retrieve an egg via the network.

The file {{<PREFIX>/share/chicken/setup.defaults}} holds various
parameters that define where eggs should be downloaded, together
with more obscure options, and can be used to customize the
sources where eggs will be retrieved from. Adding a line of 
the form

{{(location "<PATH>")}}

will add {{<PATH>}} as an additional egg source, where {{<PATH>}}
should be a directory in the local filesystem that contains
any number of eggs, one directory for each, including the source code
and the {{.egg}} files for each egg.

Locations are searched before trying to retrieve from the network.
Any number of locations may be defined.


=== The egg cache

Eggs are downloaded and built in the so called "egg cache", an
intermediate location used for storing already downloaded source code
and for providing a temporary location for building the eggs before
they are installed.

By default the cache is located in the directory
{{.chicken-install.cache}} is the user's home directory ({{$HOME}} on
UNIX, or {{%USERPROFILE%}} on Windows. If the respective environment
variable is not set, then {{/tmp}} or {{/Temp}} is used.

Built extensions and programs remain in the cache, to avoid rebuilding
already compiled code and multiple downloads of eggs in case the
installation of an egg fails - the dependencies will be cached after
the first download and re-download is not needed.

{{chicken-install}} tries to take extreme care to avoid stale binaries,
but should you be in doubt, simply delete the directory, or run
{{chicken-install -purge}} to clear the cache or parts of it.

You can override the location of the cache by setting the
{{CHICKEN_EGG_CACHE}} environment variable.


=== Egg installation in detail

==== Retrieval

First the egg names given on the command line (or, if no arguments
are given, all eggs identified by {{.egg}} files in the current 
directory, including any in a subdirectory named {{chicken}})
must be retrieved, either from a local source or from the official
egg repository. Should the egg exist in the egg cache we check
whether this cached version is out of date. A cached egg is 
considered out of date, if a) it is locally available and all cached
files belonging to the egg do not have newer timestamps than the
local files, or b) if it is a remotely retrieved egg and no
newer versions exist on the remote egg server and the last time
the cache was filled from the remote location is not later than
one hour. Additionally, if any changes in certain environment
variables that may influence the compilation of an egg, or if
the CHICKEN version changed, then retrieval of the egg sources
is enforced in any case.

If the egg is in the current directory, or in
a "location" (as described above), the files are copied into
the cache. If the egg is remotely available, then it is retrieved
via HTTP from one of the egg servers defined in {{setup.defaults}}.

Once the egg sources are retrieved and stored in the cache,
their {{.egg}} files are loaded and validated. After this
any egg dependencies are resolved and located in the cache,
triggering a recursive retrieval, if necessary.

==== Preparation

Unless the {{-retrieve}} option was given, the eggs intended
to be built and installed are now scheduled for compilation.
The egg information from the {{.egg}} files is processed and
translated into build and install scripts for the current
platform - if this CHICKEN was configured for cross compilation,
and no separate host- or target-build was selected, two sets
of build/install scripts will be generated, one for the host
system and one for the target.

==== Building and installation

Unless {{-dry-run}} was given on the command-line, the build-
and install scripts are now executed, ordered by the dependency
relationships between the full set of eggs that are scheduled
for compilation. If the {{-test}} option was given and a file named
{{run.scm}} exists in the {{tests}} subdirectory of the egg
sources, then this script is executed. Should it terminate with
an error or a non-zero exit code, the installation is still performed
and {{chicken-install}} does not abort. Only after all scheduled
eggs have been installed, {{chicken-install}} will terminate
with a non-zero exit code.

Note that the build process attempts to minimize re-building
of already compiled files in the cache, using the {{chicken-do}}
program. See the manual page for {{chicken-do}} for more details.

From the egg-information in the {{.egg}} file, the set of files
installed for a particular egg are added to the egg-information
and stored together with the build-artifacts produced by the
build scripts.
