== Module (chicken flonum)

Because CHICKEN supports a full numeric tower, operations can
sometimes incur a subtantial overhead to simply detect the type of numbers
you're passing in.  When you know you're definitely dealing only with
flonums, you can choose to use flonum-specific operations to avoid
this overhead.

This is purely a performance hack.  You might want to consider adding
[[Types|type annotations]] instead, this often gives the same
performance boost without having to rewrite all numeric operators in
your code.

Arithmetic floating-point operations.

In safe mode, these procedures throw a type error when given non-float
arguments. In unsafe mode, these procedures do not check their
arguments. A non-flonum argument in unsafe mode can crash the
application.

Note: {{fpround}} uses the rounding mode that your C library
implements, which is usually different from R5RS.

Platform-specific flonum limits.

<procedure>(flonum-print-precision [PRECISION])</procedure>

Gets and sets the number of significant digits printed for a floating-point
number. {{PRECISION}} must be a positive {{fixnum}}.  Returns
the setting that was previously in effect.

The default print precision is 15 on nearly all systems, and 7
on the rare system on which the {{double}} type is only single-precision.

'''Note:''' To ensure read/write invariance for ''all'' floating-point
numbers, you must increase print precision from 15 to 17 (or from 7 to
9).  For example:

 > (define a (expt 2 -53))
 > (define b (+ a (* 2 (expt 10 -32))))
 > (eqv? a b)
 #f
 > (flonum-print-precision 15)
 > (cons a b)
 (1.11022302462516e-16 .
  1.11022302462516e-16)            ;; same printed representation
 > (flonum-print-precision 17)
 > (cons a b)
 (1.1102230246251565e-16 .
  1.1102230246251568e-16)          ;; differs in last place

On the downside, this will result in unnecessarily precise
representations of many numbers:

 > (flonum-print-precision 17)
 > 0.1
 0.10000000000000001

The maximum number of decimal digits required to uniquely represent
all floating-point numbers of a certain precision is given by the
formula {{ceil(1+N*log10(2))}}, where N is the number of bits of
precision; for double-precision, {{N=53}}.
