== Module (chicken time posix)

This module provides procedures for conversion between seconds since
the epoch ("POSIX time"), strings and a 10-element vector type
containing the distinct time units.


=== seconds->local-time

<procedure>(seconds->local-time [SECONDS])</procedure>

Breaks down the time value represented in {{SECONDS}} into a 10
element vector of the form {{#(seconds minutes hours mday month
year wday yday dstflag timezone)}}, in the following format:

; seconds (0) : the number of seconds after the minute (0 - 59)
; minutes (1) : the number of minutes after the hour (0 - 59)
; hours (2) : the number of hours past midnight (0 - 23)
; mday (3) : the day of the month (1 - 31)
; month (4) : the number of months since january (0 - 11)
; year (5) : the number of years since 1900
; wday (6) : the number of days since Sunday (0 - 6)
; yday (7) : the number of days since January 1 (0 - 365)
; dstflag (8) : a flag that is true if Daylight Saving Time is in effect at the time described.
; timezone (9) : the difference between UTC and the latest local standard time, in seconds west of UTC.

{{SECONDS}} defaults to
the value of {{(current-seconds)}}.

=== local-time->seconds

<procedure>(local-time->seconds VECTOR)</procedure>

Converts the ten-element vector {{VECTOR}} representing the time value relative to
the current timezone into
the number of seconds since the first of January, 1970 UTC.

=== local-timezone-abbreviation

<procedure>(local-timezone-abbreviation)</procedure>

Returns the abbreviation for the local timezone as a string.

=== seconds->string

<procedure>(seconds->string [SECONDS])</procedure>

Converts the time represented in {{SECONDS}} into a local-time string
of the form {{"Tue May 21 13:46:22 1991"}}. {{SECONDS}} defaults to
the value of {{(current-seconds)}}.

=== seconds->utc-time

<procedure>(seconds->utc-time [SECONDS])</procedure>

Similar to {{seconds->local-time}}, but interpretes {{SECONDS}}
as UTC time. {{SECONDS}} defaults to
the value of {{(current-seconds)}}.

=== utc-time->seconds

<procedure>(utc-time->seconds VECTOR)</procedure>

Converts the ten-element vector {{VECTOR}} representing the UTC time value into
the number of seconds since the first of January, 1970 UTC.

'''NOTE''': On native Windows builds (all except cygwin), this
procedure is unimplemented and will raise an error.

=== time->string

<procedure>(time->string VECTOR [FORMAT])</procedure>

Converts the broken down time represented in the 10 element vector
{{VECTOR}} into a string of the form represented by the {{FORMAT}}
string. The default time form produces something like {{"Tue May 21 13:46:22 1991"}}.

The {{FORMAT}} string follows the rules for the C library procedure {{strftime}}. The default {{FORMAT}} string is "%a %b %e %H:%M:%S %Z %Y".

=== string->time

<procedure>(string->time TIME [FORMAT])</procedure>

Converts a string of the form represented by the {{FORMAT}} string
into the broken down time represented in a 10 element vector. The
default time form understands something like {{"Tue May 21 13:46:22 1991"}}.

The {{FORMAT}} string follows the rules for the C library procedure {{strptime}}. The default {{FORMAT}} string is "%a %b %e %H:%M:%S %Z %Y".
