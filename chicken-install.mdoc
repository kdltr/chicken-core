.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Ar OPTION ...
.Op Ar NAME[:VERSION] ...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
downloads, compiles and installs a prepackaged extension library from sources.
If no extension name is given on the command line, then any existing
.Em egg
descriptions in the current directory will be executed in unspecified order.
.Pp
The program accepts following arguments:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl h , Fl help
Show usage and exit.
.It Fl version
Show version and exit.
.It Fl v , Fl verbose
Print extra information during installation.
.It Fl force
Install without confirmation, even if versions don't match.
.It Fl k , Fl keep
Keep temporary files.
.It Fl s , Fl sudo
Use an external program to elevate privileges for filesystem operations.
The program defaults to
.Xr sudo 8
but can be overridden with the
.Ev SUDO
environment variable.
.It Fl r , Fl retrieve
Just retrieve the egg, don't install it
.No (giving Fl r No more than once implies Fl recursive Ns ).
.It Fl recursive
.No If Fl retrieve No is given, also fetch dependencies recursively.
.It Fl dry-run
Do not build or install, just print the locations of the generated build
& install scripts.
.It Fl list-versions
List available versions for the given eggs.
.It Fl purge
Remove cached files for given eggs (or purge cache completely).
.It Fl host
When cross-compiling, only compile extensions for host.
.It Fl target
When cross-compiling, only compile extensions for target.
.It Fl test
Run included test cases, if available.
.It Fl n , Fl no-install
Do not install the egg, just build it.
.It Fl no-install-dependencies
Do not install dependencies. Note that this option may result in build
failures due to missing extension libraries.
.It Fl u , Fl update-db
Update export database.
.It Fl repository
Print path used for egg installation.
.It Fl override Ar filename
Override versions for installed eggs with information from
.Ar filename .
.It Fl from-list Ar filename
Install eggs listed in
.Ar filename ,
which has the same format as
.Xr chicken-status 1 Ns 's
.Fl list No output.
This option may be given multiple times.
.It Fl cached
Install given eggs from cache and do not download.
.It Fl feature , Fl D Ar name
Register feature 
.Ar name ,
usable as a condition in cond-expand clauses.
.El
.Sh ENVIRONMENT
Following environment variables change the behaviour of
.Nm Ns :
.Bl -tag -width CHICKEN_INSTALL_REPOSITORY
.It Ev CHICKEN_EGG_CACHE
Location where eggs are retrieved and built.
.It Ev CHICKEN_INSTALL_REPOSITORY
The path where extension libraries are installed. Defaults to the
package library path selected during configuration
.Pq usually $prefix/lib/chicken/<binary-version> .
.It Ev SUDO
The command to execute when using
.Fl s
flag in command. If not provided, defaults to
.Xr sudo 8 .
.El
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width 4n
.It Pa $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/chicken/setup.defaults
User specific setup.defaults file. (
.Ev $XDG_CONFIG_HOME
defaults to
.Pa $HOME/.config
)
.It Pa $prefix/share/chicken/setup.default
System-wide setup.defaults file.
.It Pa $XDG_CACHE_HOME/chicken-install/
Default directory for cached eggs. (
.Ev $XDG_CACHE_HOME
defaults to
.Pa $HOME/.cache
)
.El
.Sh EXIT STATUS
The
.Nm
utility exits 0 on success, 2 if the user aborted an operation, 3 if it
was invoked with no explicitly given egg names and no *.egg files could
be found in the current directory, and >0 if any other error occurs.
.Sh EXAMPLES
Install
.Sq regex
egg as root user:
.Pp
.Dl # chicken-install regex
.Pp
Install an egg as an normal user but using
.Xr sudo 8 :
.Pp
.Dl $ chicken-install -s regex
.Pp
Install an egg as an normal user but elevating privileges with different program, such as OpenBSD
.Xr doas 1 :
.Pp
.Dl $ SUDO=/usr/bin/doas chicken-install -s regex
